Implement two different linear classifiers on the data in the attached file, a Gaussian generative model, and a logistic regression classifier. For the logistic regression classifier, you must implement the IRLS algorithm. You will need to use a 3rd basis function to separate the circles data, but you can operate directly in the feature space for the unimodal data.

Report your % correct classification (it should be very high for these simple datasets). 

Plot a ROC curve for both of your classifiers, Plot the decision boundary for both your classifiers for the unimodal data. (you can skip this for the circle one).

Next, Go to Kaggle or the UCI machine learning database, find a dataset that interests you, and try your classifiers on it. Make sure it is a binary dataset with only numerical features. Plot an ROC and  report the % correctly classified.
