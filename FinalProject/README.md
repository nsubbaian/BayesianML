The final project can be in groups of 2-3. Please try to identify at general area of interest, and a dataset(or datasets) that you would like to work with. More details on final project requirements are in the syllabus, please refer to that. Here is one possible source of inspiration:

The deliverables for your final project:

a) One extremely well commented python script/iPython Notebook/MATLAB published document, explaining your project in great detail.

b) Something that communicates your results. As discussed in class, the format for this is open. Some possible suggestions include a snappy (think George Ho style) in-class presentation,  formal (think conference talk style) in-class presentation, a TED Talk like video, a Medium style blog, artwork, poster. Feel free to be creative here. As you do this, consider who the audience is. Who do you want this to impress? How appropriate is your proposed method of communicating your work for the target audience?
