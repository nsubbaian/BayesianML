Part 1: Re-do part 2 (i.e. plotting predictions) of your linear regression assignment using the Gaussian Process method from section 6.4. Stretch goal:Try to learn the hyperparameters by maximizing eqn 6.70.

Part 1: Re-do your linear classification assignment using a Support Vector Machine. Do this for the circles dataset, and whatever other dataset you chose from UCI or whathaveyou.  Implement the grid search method outlined in this papers: https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/guide/guide.pdf, plot an ROC and report your % correct. Compare this to your results from the linear classification project.
