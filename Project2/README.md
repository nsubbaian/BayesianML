## mini-project

You must reproduce figures 3.7 and 3.8 in the textbook. The exact data they used is described in the text. Note your figure will look slightly different because they rely on random draws from the dataset.

Stretch goal for the brave: Read section 3.5 on the evidence approximation and use the approximation to find the 'best' values of alpha and beta. This can be done with eqn's 3.98 and 3.99.
